# Win10-Setup-Script
 
## Intro

 Start-Windows10InitialSetup.ps1, a Powershell script to automate and standardise the basic configuration of a PC.

 This script is intended to be used where traditional deployment & build methods such as MEMCM (MEM, SCCM, etc), Intune, MDT & others are too much overhead for the time required. Specifically within the MSP community where there are many varying clients with different hardware, software and device requirements.

 This script is intended to be run from an RMM platform. I've tested with N-Central but would welcome feedback from other platforms. To simplify deployment for those completing the device builds who may be new to scripting or the world of IT, all components are in a single script file. One file to run, no other external dependencies.

 In the original environment we had multiple build processes for each of our clients, but all of them required a similar core process. So this script was born to consolidate these core needs and provide a consistent output across the client base. Each environment has further scripts or processes which are run after this initial build, but at least we know that every box leaving our workshop is suitably configured to our basic minimum spec.

 The process for the bench tech is simple and usually takes under 5 minutes to complete:
 - Unbox the device
 - Run through OOBE
 - Install the RMM agent
 - Trigger the setup script from the RMM
 - Go and do other more interesting things while this runs

 Comments, corrections or improvements welcome
